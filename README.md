# NamePending
A quick selfstudy into how language and compilers work

In the NamePending programming language everything is expressed as a statement.

## Hello World!
A hello world program is simple enough. Create a main lambda and call the print line function
```
main = lambda(arglist){
	println('Hello World!');
};
```
Alternatively, lambda can be replaced with `λ` for a shorthand lambda declaration
```
main = λ(arglist){
	println('Hello World!');
};
```

## Conditionals
NamePending uses the `if then else` style of if statement
```
if (conditional) 
```

## Loops
