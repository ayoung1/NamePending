A quick selfstudy into how language and compilers work


## Hello World!
A hello world program is simple enough. Create a main lambda and call the print line function
```
main = lambda(arglist){
	println('Hello World!');
};
```
Alternatively, lambda can be replaced with `λ` for a shorthand function declaration
```
main = λ(arglist){
	println('Hello World!');
};
```
